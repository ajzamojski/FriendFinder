# FriendFinder

## Description
Running through `node.js` and express server package, the user
will enter information such as their name, a link to a 
photo of themselves, and complete a short survey. Depending on
how the user responds, a ‘best matched’ individual will appear
based on how close their questions matched from the survey.
